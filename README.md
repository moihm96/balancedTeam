# BALANCED TEAM

A group of friends want to play a football match. They know how good everybody is, and each friend has a numerical score. Split the group in two teams that are as balanced as possible based on the sum of their scores, to make for a fair game.

The goal is to minimize the absolute difference of the total score of the two teams. You can try first a version where the two teams do not need to have the same number of players, then improve it to another where both teams have the same size.

We implement the greedy algorithm, you can search and its well explain.

## HOW TO RUN IT
I use PyhCHarm. You just have to download or clone this proyect.
git clone https://github.com/moihm96/balancedTeam.git

And then if you run the balancedTeam file there is the execution of the algorithm given 2 examples inside.

## RUNNING TEST
Once you have clone or download the files, the file test_player_split its pur test file you can simply run it from PyCharm.It uses UnitTest to make sure that one of the best wways to split the teams and make sure they are balanced.
